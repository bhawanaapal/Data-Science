In this exercise I use the Student admission data downloaded from Kaggle and use it to predict the chances of a student getting admitted to a university based on various parameters like CGPA, LOR, SAT Score, Reputation of the university etc. 

This exercise is a simple exercise in machine learning. I also check the fitness of the model.
